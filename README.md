# Project Name: Progress Journal

## Project Description: 
My portfolio website is a reflection of my journey as a developer, crafted on a Bootstrap codebase to ensure it's as responsive as it is visually appealing. Designed with a single-page, continuous scroll layout, it centers around the theme of a progress journal, offering a glimpse into the evolution of my skills through the four main projects I've undertaken this semester. I've chosen a palette of light blue, light green, and purpleâ€”colors that are not only cool and welcoming but also bring a sense of calm and clarity to the presentation. While also infusing an element of vibrancy and natural aesthetic by incorporating background images of forests depicted in a simplistic style. These images not only bring a burst of life and color to the design but also subtly reflect my personal appreciation for nature and my design philosophy of blending simplicity with visual impact. The design is deliberately straightforward and concise, allowing visitors to easily navigate and absorb the content. I've integrated multiple links, from the project images to a belt of rounded squares adorned with corresponding icons, ensuring that every element is both functional and informative. Additionally, I've taken care to include alt tags on several images, providing descriptive text alternatives that aid in understanding and navigation, especially for those using screen readers. This website is my digital showcase, simple yet effective, inviting everyone to witness the milestones of my development journey.

## Process: 
The general process of developing my website began with the decision to utilize the Bootstrap framework, which I chose for its robust capabilities in implementing JavaScript, CSS, and ensuring responsive design. This choice was foundational, as Bootstrap's consistency across projects would allow me to focus on customization rather than basic structure. I started by revisiting the Bootstrap documentation to refresh my understanding of its components and how best to employ them in my project. Recognizing the importance of inspiration in design, I also explored various templates online, integrating elements that resonated with my vision into my own design. Each site that influenced my approach has been duly credited in my site's documentation to maintain transparency and integrity. With this groundwork in place, my next step was to refine the wireframe I had initially created for the assignment. This wireframe served as a blueprint, guiding the construction of the website and allowing me to systematically enhance and build out the site's features and user experience.

## Reflection/Evaluation: 
Reflecting on the overall experience of designing and building my portfolio site, I feel it was quite successful. I managed not only to meet but also to surpass some of the expectations I had set for this project. One aspect I'm particularly proud of is the implementation of the four icon boxes. This feature required some technical savvy, as it involved deconstructing the design from an inspiring site and translating it into something I could integrate into my own site. This process felt like I was visually breaking down the design to its core elements, then reassembling them with my own creative twist. If I had more time, I'd love to delve deeper into incorporating more JavaScript effects. The Bootstrap framework offers a myriad of seamless ways to use JavaScript, and I'm eager to explore more of these possibilities. One specific challenge I'd like to tackle is creating wave effect borders, a fascinating concept I came across during my preliminary research. This feature could elevate the dynamic feel of the website, and mastering it would be a significant achievement in my web development journey.
